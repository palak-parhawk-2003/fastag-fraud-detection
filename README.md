# üöó Fastag Fraud Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent Fastag transactions using machine learning. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development to accurately flag suspicious activities.

## üìå Project Objective
The goal is to build a predictive model that can differentiate between genuine and fraudulent Fastag transactions. Using a labeled dataset, we apply a range of machine learning techniques to boost fraud detection performance.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used contains simulated Fastag transactions, crafted for testing and educational purposes in fraud detection. It includes:
<ul>
<li>Transaction amount</li>
<li>Vehicle information</li>
<li>Geographic data</li>
<li>Timestamped transaction details</li>
<li>Fraud labels (Fraud or Not Fraud)</li>
</ul>

## üß† Methodology
This project follows a systematic ML pipeline:
<ol>
<li>Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing numerical features to prepare the dataset for analysis.</li>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating the distribution of transaction amounts, frequency of fraudulent activities, and relationships between variables to uncover patterns indicative of fraud.</li>
<li>Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting relevant ones to improve model performance.</li>
<li>Model Development: Implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.</li>
<li>Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and refining the models to enhance detection capabilities.</li>
</ol>

## üîç Key Insights
<ul>
<li>Class Imbalance: Fraud cases are much fewer than legit ones ‚Äî handled via resampling or class weighting.</li>
<li>Feature Impact: Transaction amount and vehicle type significantly influence fraud probability.</li>
<li>Model Comparison: Neural networks outperformed traditional models in capturing complex fraud patterns.</li>
</ul>
